1. Three Rotating Wheels:
   Two Hover-Activated Wheels: Upon hovering over these wheels, they initiate a smooth rotation, providing an interactive user experience.
   One Continuously Rotating Wheel: This wheel rotates continuously, demonstrating dynamic animation capabilities.
2. Modification and Customization:
   The provided problem statement was enhanced by integrating three wheels instead of one. This approach was chosen to demonstrate adaptability and the ability to iterate upon a given requirement.
## Repository Structure:  
index.html: Contains the HTML structure for the rotating wheels.  
style.css: Contains the CSS styles responsible for the visual appearance and animation of the wheels.

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone 'https://github.com/Ruchi-Mankar/RuchiMankar-SoarX-WebDevInternApplication.git'  
2. Open index.html in a web browser to view the rotating wheels in action.
## Conclusion:  
This project not only fulfills the basic requirements set by the internship task but also demonstrates creativity and a willingness to go beyond the given problem statement. The incorporation of three distinct wheels adds a unique touch and showcases a deeper understanding of frontend development.
